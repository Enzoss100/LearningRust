# Repository Breakdown

- This Repo consists of projects that compile practice projects for learning Rust.
- This project directly follows *The Rust Programming Language* book that comes with installing `rustup`
- The goal of tis repository is to be a public documentation of how I tackled learning Rust

**None of this repository contains software that is actually usable for real practical things**

**There are test projects in this repository that uses ChatGPT generated content**

## To see What projects are in this repository, and what they are for, please check the `_RepoArchive`
- in this directory you will see a README with a comprehensive, tabular breakdown of what the projects of this repo contain
- there is also a `RepoNotes.txt` for keeping track of which projects tackle which chapter in the book
    - this file tracks which projects also adhere to what the book teaches from a *beginner* perspective

### Notes from Me:
- if there are projects here are noted in `RepoNotes.txt` as not adhering to the book it was added as part of my personal learning experience with Rust
- this repository will not be a 1:1 recreation of the code snippets seen in the book
- all the projects in this repository will have my own notes in it unless noted otherwise in `RepoNotes.txt`
- this repository is meant to be a document of my own learning experience using Rust following the book
- Rust is not my first programming language, so I will be reinforcing most of what I learned using other languages like C++, PHP, Java and Python to practice programming concepts while learning Rust as a language
